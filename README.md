# Inter-BRC comparison of ecosystem & soil carbon modeling

This repository is for sharing agro-ecosystem and soil carbon model results and analysis code across the four DOE-funded Bioenergy Research Centers (BRC). It is meant to support the inter-BRC Shared Research Objective on Technoeconomic Analysis (TEA), Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Land Use and agro-ecosystem modeling (formerly SRO9):

>**PY24 SRO Outcome**—Set up ensemble models/datasets to quantify biogenic carbon cycling and uncertainty for at least one bioenergy crop, drawing on marginal land datasets, soil carbon models, and downstream LCA frameworks across the BRCs.

This is currently set up as a public repository, geared towards sharing and comparison of previous-published datasets and codes. **Proprietary or sensitive information should not be shared here, as this space is accessible to people not bound by the BRC NDA.**
This repository was originally established by John Field (FieldJL@ornl.gov) from the Center for Bioenergy Innovation (https://cbi.ornl.gov/). 


## Introduction

Process-based models are widely used to simulate the cycling of carbon, water, nitrogen, and other nutrients in managed and unmanaged ecosystems. They are widely used in bioenergy assessment, and also in carbon market monitoring, reporting & verification (MRV) protocols that attempt to quantify and valorize climate-smart agricultural practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and decrease emissions of other agricultural greenhouse gases (GHG).
Such models are uniquely useful for: 
- Synthesizing, interpolating and extrapolating limited field observations.
- Full-GHG accounting, i.e., including soil carbon, nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4).
- Scenario analysis considering novel crops, management practices, landscape designs, and future novel climates.

Each of the BRCs includes a modeling effort using the process-based DayCent model:

This provides a basic point of comparison across the projects.

## Scope of comparison 

### Crops
Each of the BRCs specializes in developing and assessing a different set of dedicated biomass crops, as shown in the matrix below.

### County-scale comparisons
Easy scale to work at for 
Supports research questions such as:
- a
- b 


### Field or sub-field-scale comparisons
Much m
Supports research questions such as:
- Marginal land
- b 


### Simulation meta-data
As we expand the data-sharing and model intercomparison effort, it will become important to track meta-data across the different datasets, potentially including:
- What crop(s) are you modeling, with what models?
- What calibration/validation data sources did you use? Are they publicly available/shareable? Targeted toward marginal land? What calibration/validation methods (by hand, param. optimization, etc.)?
- Are there any specific plant varieties/traits/behaviors you are trying to capture?
- What types of land-use transitions were modeled? For example, are the simulations targeted/restricted to marginal or abandoned land? Or do they reflect land use choices specified in a coupled economic model?
- What model outputs have you tracked/analyzed? Yield? SOC & other GHGs (esp.N2O)? Water use, quality? Spatial or inter-annual variability? Any explicit analysis of yield & SOC outcomes vs. land quality?
- What's the publication status of the analysis, and underlying datasets and code?
